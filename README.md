# Projects description


**facial-keypoint-detection-CV**  
Solution for Kaggle competition [Facial Keypoints Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection/overview/description). The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. The key points for this solution are using augmentation and transfer learning with EfficientNet. 

**churn_rfm_analysis**  
The project for churn prediction, RFM scoring clients segmentation based on depersonalized banking data. 

**credit-score-prediction**  
Model for customer’s credit rating prediction. Final solution was obtained by tuning parameters for three model – Decision Tree, Random Forrest, XGBoost. The best model is XGBoost. Also was evaluated the most important features impacting prediction.

**churn-prediction**  
The project aims to identify customers that are likely to churn or stoping to use a service.

**fasion_multiclass_classification.ipynb**   
Multiclass image classification with deep learning. TensorFlow and Keras frameworks was implemented on clothing dataset to classify images of t-shirts. Classifying images among 10 classes using transfer learning with Xception model. 

**CIFAR10+resnet20.ipynb**  
Tuning parameters for resnet18 model with CIFAR10 data and 10 classes prediction for images. Final best accuracy on validation is approximately 0.75.

**binary_classification_photo_CNN.ipynb** 
Simple convolutional network for images binary classification using Keras. The best accuracy on validation is 0.88.

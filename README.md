# Projects description


facial-keypoint-detection-CV
----------------------------
Solution for Kaggle competition [Facial Keypoints Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection/overview/description). The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. The key points for this solution are using augmentation and transfer learning with EfficientNet. 

credit_score_prediction.ipynb 
-----------------------------
Model for customer’s credit rating prediction. Final solution was obtained by tuning parameters for three model – Decision Tree, Random Forrest, XGBoost. The best model is XGBoost. Also was evaluated the most important features impacting prediction.

churn-prediction
----------------
The project aims to identify customers that are likely to churn or stoping to use a service.

test_bcc.ipynb
--------------
Credit rating prediction based on depersonalized banking data. Tuning parameters was carried out by GridSearch for several models. The best one turned out XGBoost. 

CIFAR10+resnet20.ipynb
----------------------
Tuning parameters for resnet18 model with CIFAR10 data and 10 classes prediction for images. Final best accuracy on validation is approximately 0.75.

04-neural_networks_dl.ipynb
---------------------------
Classifying images among 10 classes using transfer learning with Xception model. 

05-CNN_photo_classification.ipynb
---------------------------------

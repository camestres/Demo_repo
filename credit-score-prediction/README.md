Project description
--------------------

The aim of this poject is to predict whether a bank should lend loan to a client or not. The bank takes these decisions based on the historical record.

In the credit scoring classification problem,

* if the model returns 0, this means, the client is very likely to payback the loan and the bank will approve the loan.
* if the model returns 1, then the client is considered as a defaulter and the bank may not approval the loan.

The raw dataset is in the file **"CreditScoring.csv"** which contains 4455 rows and 14 columns:
